# Stability Approach to Regularization Selection (StARS) for High Dimensional Graphical Models

This repository contains an implementation of the StARS algorithm, from the paper *"Stability Approach to Regularization Selection (StARS) for High Dimensional Graphical Models"* by Liu, Kathryn Roeder, Larry Wasserman (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.3316.pdf).

## Requirements

Minimum requirements (see [setup.py](setup.py)):

- Standard library
- `numpy`

To run with the [Graphical Lasso](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.covariance.GraphicalLasso.html) from Scikit-learn:
- Standard library
- `numpy`
- `sklearn>=0.20`

## Example: Using the Graphical Lasso implementation from sklearn

## Example: Using an estimator of your choice
